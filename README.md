Configuration and Setup
The server uses environment variables to configure the PRAW client for OAuth authentication:

Python

# Environment variables must be set for the following keys:
os.environ["REDDIT_CLIENT_ID"] = "VoDq1m6w4nmuLk7oDUmN8Q"
os.environ["REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET"] = "rxSEa8e2uyFSK6cfrJVlAe_omhgsXQ"
os.environ["REDDIT_USER_AGENT"] = "python:futuregen:v1.0 (by u/Striking_Economy698)"
os.environ["REDDIT_REFRESH_TOKEN"] = "200334591410393-Uwlr-vfZ65KzOQGmmr2qCUV_TrT53w"
Running the Server
Bash

python reddit_server.py

(Note: The server output indicates a potential rate-limiting issue: "reddit is blocking your account because of too many actions").

‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
The server output indicates a potential issue with the underlying PRAW connection:

reddit is blocking your account because of too many actions

This suggests the authenticated Reddit account may be temporarily rate-limited or blocked due to excessive API calls. Operations that create, edit, or vote on content may fail until the block is lifted.
