
This document outlines the README for the Reddit MCP (Multi-Component Project) Server, a robust toolset built on PRAW and FastMCP for comprehensive Reddit interaction.

This project is a Python server designed to execute a wide range of Reddit actions‚Äîfrom retrieving post listings and user data to creating, editing, and moderating content‚Äîvia a unified, API-like interface.

üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

The praw library (for Reddit API interaction)

The fastmcp library (for running the Multi-Component Project server)

Installation
Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone [repository-url]
cd reddit-mcp-server
Install Dependencies:

Bash

pip install praw fastmcp
Configuration
The project requires authentication credentials to interact with the Reddit API. Set the following environment variables (as shown in the provided code snippet) in your environment or directly in the Python script.

Environment Variable	Description
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID	Your Reddit application's client ID.
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET	Your Reddit application's client secret.
REDDIT_USER_AGENT	A descriptive user agent string (e.g., python:futuregen:v1.0 (by u/YourUsername)).
REDDIT_REFRESH_TOKEN	A PRAW refresh token for script-based, long-term access without a username/password.

Example Configuration (from code):

Python

os.environ["REDDIT_CLIENT_ID"] = "VoDq1m6w4nmuLk7oDUmN8Q"
os.environ["REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET"] = "rxSEa8e2uyFSK6cfrJVlAe_omhgsXQ"
os.environ["REDDIT_USER_AGENT"] = "python:futuregen:v1.0 (by u/Striking_Economy698)"
os.environ["REDDIT_REFRESH_TOKEN"] = "200334591410393-Uwlr-vfZ65KzOQGmmr2qCUV_TrT53w"
Running the Server
Start the FastMCP server from your terminal:

Bash

python reddit_server.py
# The server is now running and ready to accept API calls.
üõ†Ô∏è Available Tools (API Endpoints)
The server exposes the following functions as callable tools for interacting with Reddit content and user data. Each function returns a dictionary with a successful boolean, a data payload, and an error string (if applicable).

‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
The server output indicates a potential issue with the underlying PRAW connection:

reddit is blocking your account because of too many actions

This suggests the authenticated Reddit account may be temporarily rate-limited or blocked due to excessive API calls. Operations that create, edit, or vote on content may fail until the block is lifted.
